Application /Google App Engine notes:

- Can't use Mysql
-- perhaps key = CallID, values = (Kris, App, Time, Notes)

- other big problem was working with datetime objects. for such a 'simple' module, got stuck for a few hours
-- turns out it was my fault! had 00:00:00 instead of just 00 (minutes)

-GQL to retrieve, rather than SQL
--Can I copy my SQL code?
---YUP

-stylesheet
--in app.yaml, the static stuff needs to be above /.*
---something i'd have never thought of.
----actually just read the documentation before you start.

-around 3 hours, and I have pretty much what I need: a form that submits data, and a place to store it.

- but should I trust google's storage? Obviously they're big, but what if I want my data. Can I export it?
- Are there SQL options? Not on their server.
- How private is this App?
--RESEARCH THAT

- What happens if you change the database model after awhile?
- self.response.out.write vs print?

-Now, onto charts
